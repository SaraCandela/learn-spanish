# Learn Spanish

Welcome to [Learn Spanish](https://saracandela.github.io/learn-spanish/).

Learn Spanish is a quiz to start learning spanish for both kids and adults, focusing on the animal kingdom. 
The idea is simple, an image is displayed with the name of the animal in English and four buttons with the answers in Spanish. 
I decided to do this project because being spanish myself I thought it will be a good oportunity to teach just a bit about my langugage.
